					<h3>You want to Volunteer at a race!</h3>
					<p>We have many opportunities to volunteer at our races. It's a great way to spend
						a day with vibrant people and get a free t-shirt! MUDD gives back to the trails 
						our races our held on. <br>
						If you want to learn more about Trails for Illinois go to: <a href="http://

						www.trailsforillinois.org/">www.trailsforillinois.org.</a></p>

						<h3>Trail Stewardship</h3>
						<p>MUDD is passionate about the outdoors! We host year around trail clean up and

							restoration days on trails and environmentally valuable land. Many runners have 

							earned their volunteer hours for races like Western States 100 in our program. Join us to 

							have fun while giving back to the places we love!</p>

							<p>MUDD is working with the non-profit organization Trail for Illinois with the vision

								that every Illinois community benefits from trails, and every Illinoisan enjoys 

								safe, active, and enjoyable outdoor trail experiences within 10 minutes of where 

								they live. We want to make your doorstep and driveway your trailhead!</p>
								
								<p>Proceeds from our race entries goes towards Trails for Illinois.</p>
