					<p>MUDD has a strong volunteer program. Every 5-8 weeks, year round, we host trail clean up days at Sternes Woods in Crystal Lake, IL. We work with the Crystal Lake Park District on wetland restoration as well as keeping the running trails clean and clear. Many runners have earned their volunteer hours for races like Western States 100 in our program. We have fun while giving back to our community.</p>

					<h3>Group Leaders</h3>
					<p>Our Group run leaders are always eager to help. Please ask if you have any questions. We try to have at least 2 leaders at every run. This page is a way to organize people to get together to run. Run at your own risk. We will do all we can to help but everyone is responsible for themselves.</p>
