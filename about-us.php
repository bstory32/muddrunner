					<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
					<p>MUDD Ultrarunning Dudes & Dudettes was started in May of 2010 with
						a dream and a little work from Michele Hartwig, Karen Shearer and 
						Holly Bochantin Thiry, and a lot of love from all our trail loving friends. 
						Our vision was to gather friends so no one would have to run alone 
						and to give back to the outdoor spaces we love.</p>

						<h3>Get out and enjoy the trails!</h3>
						<p>All levels are welcome, but if you start running with us, be cautious-
							because miles will become addictive and shorter distance runners just 
							may find themselves soon running a 50K, 50 & 100+ miles before you 
							know it! It all starts with showing up to just one MUDD run!</p>

							<h3>Gathering spots</h3>	
							<p>Saturday and Sunday mornings, a group of trail runners gather at
								Sternes Woods Parking lot (off of Hillside road) for a 8am start, but many 
								start early.  This run is usually a large group unless everyone is racing. 
								We normally have quite a few people running 2-3 hours or more.</p>
